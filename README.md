# multilevel-analysis-autism-dataset
This project applies Data Analysis using python libraries to a longitudinal dataset to explore the relationship between a child's age, expressive language skills, and their socialization development. A multilevel modeling approach is used to account for the correlated, repeated measurements taken from each child over several years.
